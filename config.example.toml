# Example configuration for livestream-to-icecast Docker deployment
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to config.toml: cp config.example.toml config.toml
# 2. Edit with your actual credentials and settings
# 3. Ensure Icecast server is accessible from the container
#    - For local development, run icecast service or use host.docker.internal
#    - For production, use your Icecast server's IP/hostname
#
# For Docker Compose, mount the config file as a volume:
#   volumes:
#     - ./config.toml:/app/config/config.toml:ro

platform = "twitch"               # or "youtube"
channel_url = "https://www.twitch.tv/your_channel"
channel_name = "YourChannelName"

poll_interval = 30                # seconds between live-status checks

[icecast]
# For Docker, use the service name (e.g., icecast) if using docker-compose network
# For local development, use host.docker.internal to reach host services

port = 8000
mount = "/live.mp3"               # mount point on the Icecast server
